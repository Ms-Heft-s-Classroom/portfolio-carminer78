        <h2>Filiment 3D Printers</h2>
        
        <p> Filiment 3d printers are any printers that print with a roll of filiment.
          And they work pretty well but they can't print with good detail.They also have there own set of problems that come with working with them. Such as the print not sticking to the plate, the nozzle getting clogged, a thermal runnaway, and many other problems. But for the most part they are very reliable printers. the filiment 3D printers print by extruding the filiment throught the head as it moves all around the plate and it prints layer by layer.</p>

        <h2> Resin 3D Printers</h2>
        
        <p>Resin 3D printers print with liquid resin and can print in 4k resolution. But resin is very dangerous to deal with, so you need a mask and gloves.Liquid resin is very toxic and is made with very dangerous chemicals.But the resin 3D printers can print in amazing detail. It prints by using UV light in very specific spots on the plate to harden the resin in that spot over and over until the print is done.After you finish printing you have to wash the print to get the accses resin off the print. Then you hardend the resis with a UV light so the resin is holdable with your bare hands. </p>

        <ol>
         
          <li>Keep plate clean.</li>
         <li>Make sure the plate is level before each print.</li>
         <li>Wash plate after every 2 to 3 prints.</li>
         <li>Be gentle with the prints while removing from the plate.</li>
         <li> Printing slower makes better quality.</li>

        <h4>Resin printer tips</h4>
         
         <ol>
           
           <li>If the prints are sticking to the bottom, clean the plastic film in the resin vat.</li>
           <li>Make sure to wear gloves and a mask when handleing uncured resin, because resin is toxic.</li>
           <li>Do not over cure resin prints, that will lead to brittle and fragile prints.</li>
           <li>Keep UV screen clean, because if you break the UV screen your goiong to need a new printer.</li>
           <li>Be gentle with prints before curing.</li>
